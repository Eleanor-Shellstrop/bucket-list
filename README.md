# Seasonal "Bucket Lists"
Project by Anne Ensign

## About:
This project is for Code Louisville's JavaScript Class, Summer 2021.

Every summer, my stepsister and her family put together a "Summer Bucket List." She, her husband and four kids brainstorm all the fun things they want to do, write it out and check them off as they complete them. 

Inspired to have more fun and enjoy being "in the moment," my family made our own list for this summer with pen to paper. Then I thought, "Why stop there?"

This is an app to make customizable, printable lists for all seasons. Included are some generated activities to add, but users can write in their own as well. 

IN PROGRESS.

### Project Requirements Met:
- Retrieve data from an external API and display data in your app (such as with fetch() or with AJAX) 
  - Random activity generator with Bored API (https://www.boredapi.com)  
- Create an array, dictionary or list, populate it with multiple values, retrieve at least one value, and use or display it in your application.
  - Multiple arrays in js folder, imported to app.js.
  - Displayed when "season" is selected from dropdown menu.
- Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event)
  - When "Christmas" is chosen for the season, a countdown clock appears in the header telling the user how many days until Christmas
